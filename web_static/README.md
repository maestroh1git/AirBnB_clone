#0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static project

## Description

Now that I have a command interpreter for managing my AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

During this project, I learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of my page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of my page, the design. It was really helpful to fix the HTML part before starting the styling.
 Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
